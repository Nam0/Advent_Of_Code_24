I cba to write an actual readme but D6P2 doesn't work due to how it checks for loops because it doesn't do it correctly, V2 does it correctly but slowly so I optomized it and did V3 which uses threading to get it down to 11 seconds yipee

Edited to add some useful tidbits for later when inventably will need to multi thread stuff again for AOC
